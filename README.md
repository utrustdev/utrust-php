# xMoney Crypto PHP

![Test Suite](https://github.com/utrustdev/utrust-php/workflows/Test%20Suite/badge.svg)

The official PHP library for the [xMoney Crypto API](https://docs.crypto.xmoney.com/).

## Minimum Requirements

- PHP version 5.4 or above.

## Install

Install with composer:

```
composer require utrust/utrust
```

## Usage

### API Client

Creating a new Order:

```php
use Utrust\ApiClient;

$utrustApi = new ApiClient('API_KEY');

$orderData = [...];
$customerData = [...];

$response = $utrustApi->createOrder($orderData, $customerData);
echo $response->attributes->redirect_url;
```

Check the full example [here](https://github.com/utrustdev/utrust-php/blob/master/examples/create_simple_order.php).

### Validations

The `Validator` class can be used to check your data array before passing it to the API Client.
It will throw an exception with the errors array if the validations don't pass, otherwise it will return `true`:

```php
$orderIsValid = Validator::order($orderData);
$customerIsValid = Validator::customer($customerData);

if ($orderIsValid && $customerIsValid) {
    // create the order here
}
```

### Webhooks

The `Webhook\Event` class can be used to verify an incoming event via Webhook.
It will throw an exception if the event has an invalid format or invalid signature:

```php
$event = new Event($payload);
$event->validateSignature($webhooksSecret);
```

Check the `examples/` directory for further details.
